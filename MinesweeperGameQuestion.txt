Minesweeper
The objective of the game is to clear a minefield without detonating a land mine. The player is
initially presented with a n*n grid of square ones. Some randomly-selected squares, unknown
to the player, are designated to contain mines.

On each turn, the player has to select a square (x,y)to indicate if it contains a mine (flag a mine)
or if it is safe and does not have a mine(open a cell).

If the square containing a mine is opened, the player loses the game.
If it does not contain a mine, the square displays '0'.

The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either safely
reveal each square or flag the square as containing a mine. The game is won when all
mine-free squares are revealed, because all mines have been located.

Sample Input:

Enter the minefield layout : xxm,xmx,xxx
(This represents a 3*3 mine field with mines located in 0,2 and 1,1 locations. The program
should then display the grid as shown below with all squares concealed.)

Enter option : 0(0,1)
(this option specifies to open location 0,1. The program should then display the grid as shown
below. 0 is displayed in 0,1 since there are some mines adjacent to it in 0,2 and 1,1.)

Wow, you cleared the minefield.! Game over !
Note that the player has to open all locations that do not contain a mine. If some squares are
flagged but do not contain a mine, the player still has to continue and open the squares that
don't have mines. If the player requires, they can open a location that has already been flagged.
